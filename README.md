My name is Justin! I'm a Full-Stack Developer from General Assembly

I'm a huge Backend development fanboy and have a passion for designing and engineering .Net/NodeJS APIs and Microservices!

Here's a short list of my skills:


-NodeJS / Express / JavaScript


I not only like writing code for efficiency and performance, but also with security and simplicity in mind. I want to know that users can trust that what I and my team builds will give them some peace of mind. Efficient, simple, and secure code is good code.
